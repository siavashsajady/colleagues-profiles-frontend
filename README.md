## Process

First, I started of just setting up the project by set up all the default frontend folders files and dependencies for my [Next.js] website.

Once this was done I created a layout for all the pages and installed TailwindCSS.

I first wanted to get a basic design and routes set up before I began to work on the specific features. I chose to use [TailwindCSSI](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my UI framework to be able to get quick access to UI components. For me, one of the top benefits of using a framework like TailwindCSS is the accessibility and responsive features you get for free.

Next, I created a JSON API and started to fetch data from API routes. One reason that I choose to use Next.js is the ability to create API routes within the Next.js structure, inapi folder in pages folder [Next.js API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
